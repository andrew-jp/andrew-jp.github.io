            <p>
              I'm a recent CS graduate in search of a career in environmental data science.
              I possess a wide range of skills, I'm an exceptional problem solver, and I'm easy to work with.
              I've spent a lot of my life in the outdoors, and I've gained a
              huge appreciation for our natural resources and environment, and hope to apply my skills
              in the field, specifically to the fields of Marine Biology and Oceanography.
              I'm currently in the job market, as well as applying to masters programs in Data Science.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of my career interests, I'm an avid climber, skier, and cyclist.
              I'm a big fan of Star Wars, and all sci-fi in general. I'm easy to get along with, 
              friendly, and great with teams. I was born in the Bay Area, but moved to Utah when I was young
              and have been here ever since. While the world class climbing and skiing has spoiled me,
              my childhood experiences at the Monterey Bay Aquarium had a deep and lasting impact on me.
              They're what drive me towards ocean science, even now.
